# Learn-It.dev

This project is my own, personal take on what a modern and more interactive LMS
could look like.

TLDR:

Anyone, who is not logged-in, can look at blogposts published on my site from
any other student or teacher. Students, who want to learn about IT-Topics can
Authenticate on my site using their Github-Accounts. After signing-in, Students
can log their learning-journey using blogposts written in markdown-like syntax,
using the beautiful **BlockNote-Editor**. I, as well as any other Teacher, who
wants to publish their courses here, can (eventually) request to get the
"teacher" account-role. After that, they are free to create and publish courses,
containing the very same, awesome-looking BlockNote-content, as well as Videos,
structuring the courses into chapters, attach Github-Codespaces, integrate
Quizzes and much more.

## Contribution

Currently, I am not accepting random contributions. However, if you want to
cringe at me, trying to figure this project out, you may want to take a look at
my Twitch.tv, where I livestream parts of the building-process of this project.
These streams will happen on a iregular basis. Fridays is your best bet for
catching me live ^\_^
